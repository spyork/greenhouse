This code is meant to be compiled on the Arduino IDE platform. The original code was developed on the Uno R3, but was later ported to the Uno R4.

The greenhouse is a small 10x12 foot shed style building with polycarbonate walls and roof, except the north wall, which is solid and insulated with reflective batts.
The greenhouse has a main fan, a double louver for the wet wall (cooling), a vent louver for lowering humidity, a punmp for the wetwall, and a dehumidifier for managing excess 
humidity late in the growing season.

All devices are controlled from an external case, which contains arduino R4, and a series of relays which control the above mentioned devices.
